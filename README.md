# Auto iPhone Frame
Temporary solution for laziness and all usage requirements must be met for script to run properly. Was created mainly for creation of mobile phone images in PW.

# Credits
Full credits to recreationx[https://github.com/recreationx] for the code and coming up with this within a day or so. Thanks for carrying the team xD.

# Usage

1. Directory **must** contain the following:

- input folder
- output folder
- frame.png

(Note: **Images must be of size `375 x 812` (3x export for iPhone frame in Adobe XD)**. Place images in `input` and run the script. If false positives are detected by your AV due to creation of folders, turn off AV temporarily.)

2. Download zip file of the code (green button near filename)

3. Run

```bash
> cd Downloads
> cd iphone-frame-code-master
> iPhoneFrame.py
```

in a terminal of your choice.
